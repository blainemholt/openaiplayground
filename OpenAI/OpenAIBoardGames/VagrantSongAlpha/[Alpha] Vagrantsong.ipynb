      "Sometimes that’s all you need to keep a friend in fighting spirits! Revivalist's Starting Skills: Soothing Hymn (#59) and Copal Incense (#60) Revivalist's Playstyle: He’s always got eyes on his friends and their well-being Runaway: Accompanied by her loyal pup, the Runaway has fled home in search of a new adventure. She’s eager to see the world, but it’s definitely a little intimidating… or it would be, without her shaggy best friend! Runaway's Passive - Girl’s Best Friend: You have the Pup. The Runaway has two standees: the Runaway and the Pup. When placing Vagrants during Scenario Setup, place the Pup in an open space adjacent to the Runaway. The Pup is only ever removed from the train board if the Runaway is removed. The Pup and Runaway are considered the same Vagrant. If both the Pup and Runaway are aected by a single eect, only the Runaway is aected. They share Humanity, Coins, Junk eects, the Rummage value, and Haint Eects. Coins may be placed on the Pup card to have the Pup perform Move, Investigate, or Bust during the Runaway’s turn. The Pup is considered a Vagrant for targeting purposes, but is not aected by being Haunted by Haints (but if the Haint ends their Move in the same space, then the Pup would still Move 1). The Pup cannot use Rummage Tokens or perform the Rummage Action. If the Pup finds a Rummage Token via an Event, it is placed on the Pup’s card. The Pup may hold onto it so long as it does not exceed the Runaway’s Rummage value. It must be traded or given to another Vagrant in order to be used. If the Pup trades/gives a Rummage Token to the Runaway, the Runaway cannot use a Rummage Token that round. Runaway's Starting Skills: Who’s a Good Boy?! (#43) and Gumption (#44) - and don’t forget about the Pup card! Runaway's Playstyle: With two characters to control, she can spread out and get plenty done in a turn.\n",

      "Wayfarer: Stories come and go, just like people do. For the Wayfarer, this journey is just another tale to tell. What better way to spin a yarn than with some new friends? Wayfarer's Passive - Thrifty: You may hold one additional Junk. Junk provides more Humanity and additional passive eects, and having one more puts the odds in your favor. Place the second Junk beside the first on your Vagrant card. Wayfarer's Starting Skills and Junk: In a Pinch (#75), Feathery Friend (#76), and Writer’s Satchel (Junk #31) Wayfarer's Playstyle: He’s always got the right tools to use at the right times. The Vagrant Card: Below is an annotated example of a Vagrant Card detailing the elements of each card and how other cards work in conjunction with it. VAGRANT NAME & SYMBOL: Here is the name of each Vagrant and their symbol, which is also featured on their Coins and Exclusive Skills. PASSIVES: Passives provide Vagrants with special bonuses and eects in the Scenario Phase HUMANITY: Each Vagrant has a Humanity value indicated by the solidcolored heart, which dictates the maximum number of Humanity they have at a time. Skill Card: Skill cards provide special Actions that Vagrants can perform when placed in the appropriate Skill slot and side. When a Vagrant suers a Wound, flip over one of their Skill cards. That Vagrant can no longer perform the Action on that Skill card. SKILL SLOTS (4): Skill cards are placed face up on the Vagrant card in any of one of the four Skill slots. Some Skills are associated with a particular side of a Vagrant card: left or right. JUNK SLOT (1): Junk cards are placed face up at the bottom of a Vagrant’s card. The Junk slot can only hold one Junk card at a time. The Wayfarer is the only Vagrant that has two Junk Slots. Junk Card: Junk cards provide passive eects (and occasionally actions or other bonuses) for that Vagrant. When Junk becomes Broken, flip over that Junk card. Its eect is no longer active Placing Skills and Junk: When placing a Skill, place it face up (with the Skill text) beside your Vagrant card in an available Skill slot.\n",

      "Vagrant's PASSIVES: Passives provide Vagrants with special bonuses and eects in either the Scenario or Camp Phase. So long as the Vagrant is currently being played, the Passive is always considered to be a rule that is followed by all characters and other game eects, regardless of whether it is the Vagrant’s turn. Choosing Actions as a Vagrant: At the beginning of a Vagrant’s turn, if there are any number of their Coins on the train board, they are returned to that Vagrant. Then that Vagrant places their Coins on Skills and/or General Actions they wish to perform during their turn. The more Coins that a Vagrant places on an Action, the stronger or more potent it can become. Vagrants may perform multiple Actions during their turn by placing individual Coins on each of those Actions, or focus on a single Action to increase that Action’s success rate, power, or potential by placing multiple Coins on it. After all Coins are placed, the Vagrant performs their Actions in any order they wish. An Action may only be taken if the Target and Range values can be met (more on that in a bit). Vagrant's COINS: In general, a Vagrant will have 3 Coins available to them on their turn. Coins are placed to decide the potency (or increase the success rate) of an Action taken by a Vagrant. Coins may be placed freely on General Actions this way, but may only be placed on Skills (and Junk cards that require Coins) if that card had 0 Coins placed on it during the previous round. BONES: Success when performing Actions in Vagrantsong is not guaranteed. When attempting an Action that lists a number of Bones or has a Success value that must be met in order to succeed, a Vagrant will roll that many Bones to see if (and possibly by how much) their Action succeeds. Each Bone roll that meets or exceeds the Action’s Success value is considered a success Booming Boxcars: If a Vagrant rolls a 6 on a Bone when performing an Action, they may immediately roll an additional Bone for that Action. If a Vagrant rolls a 6 again, they gain another Bone to roll for that Action (continuing to gain Bones on rolls of 6, if able). These Bones are considered part of the initial roll and not as a separate Action.\n",
