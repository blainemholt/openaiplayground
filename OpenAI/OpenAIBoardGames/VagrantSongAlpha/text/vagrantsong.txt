CYCLE EFFECT 
Many Haints will have a Cycle Effect that is performed after any current 
actions being performed (such as a Haint or Vagrant turn). If 
during a Vagrant Rummage Action or for a Haint’s Action. Their Coins are not added to 
the group’s pool of Coins that are used when choosing 
Actions during the Camp Phase, but the Vagrant that 
player chooses may gain any Skills and/or Junk from the 
group’s Belongings.

and all Vagrants in play gain 1 Humanity. 

Threshold
Each Scenario with a Haint has a Threshold (indicated by the H in 
the example above), which varies based on total player count, that 
dictates how much Humanity a Haint must gain before they Break. 
Vagrants may Move through the summoned character (but 
not end in that space), and Haints may Haunt it (to remove 
it from the train board). During the Scenario, his

During this step, put away any components from the previous

Scenario, Shelter from the Storm, including the Ritual 
card’s objective side and the Reward side once the 
objective has been met. Coins may be placed on the Pup

The Cycle Effect is triggered when the number of any Rummage Token 
on the Cycle Track is equal to (or exceeds) its Cycle value. When attempting an Action that 
lists a number of Bones or has a Success value that 
must be met in order to succeed, a Vagrant will roll 
that many Bones to see if (and possibly by how much) their Action 
succeeds.
  Each Bone roll that meets or exceeds the Action’s Success value 
is considered a success.

The Camp Phase

The Camp Phase occurs after each Scenario Phase has concluded. If multiple Event Tokens are 
drawn, resolve the Event Tokens numerically, from lowest to 
highest. After an Event from an Event Token is resolved during a 
Vagrant’s turn, the Vagrant who drew the Token draws another 
Rummage Token to fulﬁll their Rummage Action. If there is an Event on 
the Humanity Track and the Haint’s Humanity Token moves past 
the Humanity Track and the Haint’s Humanity Token moves past 
the Humanity Track and the Haint’s Humanity Token moves past 
it, the Event is immediately resolved after the Humanity Token is

Setting Up the Junk Deck
During the very ﬁrst Camp Phase, take all the Tier 1 
Junk cards and shuffle them, then place the top Junk 
card from the deck near DC to represent the Junk he is 
offering during the Camp Phase. If a Vagrant would ever have more 
Rummage Tokens than they are able, they must put Rummage 
Tokens back into the Bindle until they have a number equal to 
their Rummage value. Event Tokens that are treated as Rummage 
Tokens cannot be put back into the Bindle this way and are put 
aside instead.

If a Haint would Move, but there are multiple paths that the Haint 
can take, ﬁrst choose the path that follows the Hobo Code (if there

worst outcome for Vagrants, pg. 28). 
Players will collaboratively make choices during this step. Or, at least it doesn’t have to be. MOVE
For each Coin placed on this Action, that Vagrant 
may Move orthogonally (left, right, up, and down, 
but not diagonally) a number of spaces up to or
