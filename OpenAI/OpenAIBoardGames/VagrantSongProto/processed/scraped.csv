0,vagrant,"vagrant. In Vagrantsong, the ultimate goal is collaborative fun. Remember these when playing: 1. Rules on Events, cards, and Scenarios supersede rules in this Rule Book. If these rules contradict one another, follow the rules on the Event first, then the card (such as an In-Between or Skill card), then the Scenario, and finally this Rule Book. 2. If there is ever a rule or eect that seems confusing or contradictory, resolve the rules contradiction in the way that the players believe is the worst possible resolution for Vagrants in that moment. This includes rules and eects that provide equal outcomes (such as two possible targets or two possible Move directions). 3. If players cannot decide how to break a tie, who goes first, or have a disagreement, they are encouraged to roll Bones (pg. 10) to determine the outcome. Let the dice decide! 4. Sometimes components used for one thing, such as Tokens, are used for something else in a Scenario. Make sure to always read the Scenario Rules! 5. It’s encouraged to keep a pen and scrap paper handy to jot down notes and various bits of information Vagrantsong is a story-driven game where players take on the role of Vagrants who find themselves trapped on a ghostly train. Players will have to work together to face their fears and reveal the mystery behind their new surroundings. But they will soon realize that they are not alone on this locomotive. Haints, the lost spirits hanging onto both life and death, are just as trapped on this train. They’ll stop at nothing to ensure that the Vagrants accompany them… forever. No traveler will be the same at the end of Vagrantsong as they were the moment they began. Now grab your stu - it’s time to hop aboard! Vagrantsong is played in two phases: the Scenario Phase and the Camp Phase. During the Scenario Phase, players will attempt to survive the train ride by performing various Actions while also trying to free the Haint by giving it back its lost Humanity. After the Scenario Phase is complete, players move onto the Camp Phase, where players will pool together their resources to heal, gain new Skills, and plan for the next adventure. Player Count: Vagrantsong is a fully cooperative game for 2-4 players, where each player controls their own Vagrant. Throughout the campaign, players may be added (or removed) during the Camp Phase, which takes place between each Scenario. Victory Conditions: Each Scenario will have its own Victory Condition(s). Normally,these Victory Conditions are based on returning a Haint’s Humanity so that it can be saved or completing Rituals in orderto progress to the next Scenario. Win or lose, players will have opportunities to continue their journey. Make sure to always read the Victory Condition when starting a Scenario. DEFEAT:Some Scenarios will also have a Defeat Condition. Normally, when all Vagrants become Westbound (pg. 13), they are defeated, but Scenarios may include dierent or additional ways for Vagrants to be defeated. Victorious or not, Vagrants will move onto the next Scenario, albeit a little worse for wear. The Train Board: All Scenarios are played on the Train Board. Each Scenario will adjust certain aspects of the Train Board, such as adding Terrain and Event Tokens in specific locations, but there are constants that won’t change between Scenarios. The following rules are always in effect to help players situate and orient themselves during gameplay. THREE TRAIN CARS A, B, and C: The Train Board is separated into three separate train cars. There are spaces between that connect train cars. CONNECTING SPACES: The connecting spaces are the spaces between two train cars. The conencting space closest to the Humanity Track is part of the train car to the left of that space, and the connecting space closest to the Cycle Track is part of the train car to the right. Connecting spaces do not have the wooden border around them, and are not adjacent to any edge. ROUND TRACK: Denotes the current round. The Round Marker moves up by 1 when all Vagrants have taken their turn and the Haint has taken their last turn in that round. CYCLE TRACK: During their turn, Haints draw Rummage Tokens to determine which Actions they take. This section of the Train Board is used to keep these Tokens until they are Cycled back into the Bindle. Each Rummage Token has its own Cycle value listed to the right of that Token’s symbol, representing how many Rummage Tokens of a specific type the Cycle Track can hold before all Tokens are Cycled back into the Bindle. More on Cycling can be found on page 22. SIDES AND EDGES: Sides and edges are referenced throughout the game by various effects, such as “Move toward Round side” EDGES: Along the outside of train cars are wooden borders called edges. Some eects will refer to these edges. Usually, these effects will ask Vagrants to move toward or away from the edges, or the eect may do something to the Vagrant if they are in a space adjacent to an edge. HUMANITY TRACK: Denotes the Haint’s current Humanity. This track has two markers: a Humanity Marker representing the Haint’s current Humanity, and a Humanity Threshold that indicates the maximum amount of Humanity a Haint can get before that Haint Breaks. CARD SLOTS: This area of the board holds various cards that impact the Scenario, such as the 3 Ritual cards that Vagrants may perform, the Séance card (if the Séance was performed in the previous Camp Phase), and a mysterious card slot that players will learn about during the campaign. BREAK TRACK: Denotes how much fight the Haint still has left. Whenever a Haint Breaks, the Break marker moves toward 1. When the Haint would Break and its Break Track is already at 1, the Vagrants have successfully saved them! Starting Off (Choosing Vagrants): Vagrants are travelers, hobos, and inquisitive explorers who have found themselves down on their luck. The first thing players will need to decide before diving into the first Scenario is which Vagrant they would like to play. Each player chooses a Vagrant, then gets out their 3 Coins, their standee(s), their Vagrant card, and their 2 Starting Skills. Once each player has chosen a Vagrant, each player then takes a Humanity Token and places it on top of their maximum Humanity (indicated by a solid-colored heart), then places their Starting Skills (and/or Junk) into their appropriate slots on their Vagrant card. Cursebearer: The Cursebearer has been running for a very long time. Armed with her guile and trusty knife, she hopes to defeat the creature of darkness that pursues her... she just needs to figure out how. Passive: Devil On Your Heels. Once per turn, after you are Haunted, that Haint gains 1 Humanity. A Haint will regret Haunting you with this potent defensive effect! Starting Skills: Old Knife, Strange Blade (#67) and Distant Memory (#68). Playstyle: An aggressive, Haint-focused Vagrant who is always on the move. Empress: Despite few people acknowledging her as the Empress of America, she hasn’t stopped spreading her message or trying to amass an army. If any ghosts think they can stop her, they’re sorely mistaken. Passive: Boxcar Queen. The first time you roll a Booming Boxcar per turn, roll an extra Bone. With a little bit of luck, you can get the upper hand and teach a Haint a thing or two! Starting Skills: General’s Orders (#51) and Strangely Resonant Speech (#52). Playstyle: A hard hitter and born leader who likes to embrace the unpredictable. Songsmith: The bright lights of the big city have tugged on the Songsmith’s strings since childhood. He’s dreaming of performing on those grand stages, pouring out the music in his heart for all to hear. Passive: Upbeat Tempo. If you only have 1 Coin on a Skill, reduce the success value of that Skill by 1. Spreading out the Skills and Actions that you perform per turn will make them a little easier! Starting Skills: A Little Rhythm (#35) and An Old Medley (#36). Playstyle: A versatile generalist who dabbles in a little bit of everything - from a distance. Revivalist: After failing to bring solace to the bereaved by attempting to speak to the dead, the Revivalist left his hometown to wander, hoping to find his purpose. Passive: Selfless. When you would gain Humanity, you may have another Vagrant in Range 2 gain that Humanity instead. This Passive helps the Revivalist extend his healing reach a little bit further. Sometimes that’s all you need to keep a friend in fighting spirits! Starting Skills: Soothing Hymn (#59) and Copal Incense (#60). Playstyle: He’s always got eyes on his friends and their well-being. Runaway: Accompanied by her loyal pup, the Runaway has fled home in search of a new adventure. She’s eager to see the world, but it’s definitely a little intimidating… or it would be, without her shaggy best friend! Passive: Girl’s Best FriendYou have the Pup. The Runaway has two standees: the Runaway and the Pup. When placing Vagrants during Scenario Setup, place the Pup in an open space adjacent to the Runaway. The Pup is only ever removed from the train board if the Runaway is removed. The Pup and Runaway are considered the same Vagrant. If both the Pup and Runaway are affected by a single eect, only the Runaway is aected. They share Humanity, Coins, Junk effects, the Rummage value, and Haint Eects. Coins may be placed on the Pup card to have the Pup perform Move, Investigate, or Bust during the Runaway’s turn. The Pup is considered a Vagrant for targeting purposes, but is not affected by being Haunted by Haints (but if the Haint ends their Move in the same space, then the Pup would still Move 1). The Pup cannot use Rummage Tokens or perform the Rummage Action. If the Pup finds a Rummage Token via an Event, it is placed on the Pup’s card. The Pup may hold onto it so long as it does not exceed the Runaway’s Rummage value. It must be traded or given to another Vagrant in order to be used. If the Pup trades/gives a Rummage Token to the Runaway, the Runaway cannot use a Rummage Token that round. Starting Skills: Who’s a Good Boy?! (#43) and Gumption (#44) - and don’t forget about the Pup card! Playstyle: With two characters to control, she can spread out and get plenty done in a turn. "
